    "Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?<br>\n",
    "The cumulative distribution function (CDF) calculates the cumulative probability for a given x-value. Use the CDF to determine the likelihood that a random observation taken from the population will be less than or equal to a particular value.<br>\n",
    "The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of a real-valued random variable X, evaluated at x, is the probability function that X will take a value less than or equal to x.<br>\n",
    "Suppose you have a random variable X that represents the number of hours a student studies for an exam. The possible values of X are between 0 and 10 hours, inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the CDF of X, you would calculate the probability that X is less than or equal to a specific value x. For example, let's say you want to find the CDF when x is 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you would find the probability that X is less than or equal to 0. This is easy, because the probability is 0, since the student cannot study negative hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you would find the probability that X is less than or equal to 1. Again, this is easy, because the probability is very low since most students would study for more than 1 hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would continue this process until you have found the probability that X is less than or equal to 6. This would involve finding the probability that the student studies between 0 and 6 hours, which might be a relatively high probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result of this process is the CDF of X. The CDF can be represented graphically as a step function, where each step represents a specific value of x and the height of the step represents the probability that X is less than or equal to that value of x.<br>\n",
    "CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) is used in probability and statistics to describe the distribution of a random variable. It has several important applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability calculation: The CDF can be used to calculate the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value. This is important for making predictions and estimates in a variety of fields, such as finance, economics, and engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the distribution: The shape of the CDF can tell us a lot about the distribution of the random variable. For example, if the CDF is skewed to the right, it means that the distribution has a longer tail to the right and that there are more high values than low values. This information can be used to make informed decisions about how to model the random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing distributions: CDFs can be used to compare different distributions. By comparing the CDFs of two or more random variables, we can determine which one is more likely to take on a certain value or range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing: CDFs are also used in hypothesis testing. By comparing the CDF of a sample with the CDF of a known distribution, we can determine whether the sample comes from the same distribution as the known distribution. This is important for making statistical inferences and drawing conclusions from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, CDFs are a valuable tool for understanding and working with probability distributions and random variables in various fields."

    "Distribution and Binomial Distribution?<br>\n",

    "In other words, it is a binary distribution that models the outcome of a single trial or experiment with only two possible outcomes. <br>\n",

    "The binomial distribution, on the other hand, describes the probability of a series of n independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success, p. In other words, the binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of trials.\n",

    "The probability mass function (PMF) of the binomial distribution is given by:\n",
