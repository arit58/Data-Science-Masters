    "Provide an example of a scenario where a larger sample size would result in a smaller margin of error. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error is the range of values above and below the sample statistic (e.g., the mean) within which the true population parameter is expected to fall with a certain degree of confidence. It is usually expressed as a percentage or a number of units.\n",

    "The margin of error in a confidence interval depends on several factors, including the sample size, the level of confidence, and the standard deviation of the population. A larger sample size generally leads to a smaller margin of error, while a smaller sample size leads to a larger margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because a larger sample size provides more information about the population and reduces the variability of the sample statistic. As the sample size increases, the standard error (the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean) decreases, which in turn reduces the margin of error.\n",
