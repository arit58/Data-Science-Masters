    " is the blueprint. Two persons,say,'John' and 'Jack', are instances of the classes and are called objects. They share some common characteristics, since both are instances of the same class, like both of them walk on two legs. But at the same time, they have different characteristics, for example, different hair colour, different height, etc."
