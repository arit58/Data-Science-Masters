    "Supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning are all types of machine learning algorithms that differ in the way they use labeled data to learn from data. Here are the main differences between them:\n",

The input data is accompanied by corresponding output values or labels. The goal is to learn a mapping function from the input data to the output labels.

    "Q6- What is train, test and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, it is common practice to split the available data into three subsets: training set, test set, and validation set. Here's an explanation of each of these subsets and their importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Set: The training set is a subset of the data used to train a machine learning model. The model is exposed to the input data and corresponding labels in the training set, and it learns to make predictions or decisions based on these inputs. The importance of the training set is that it is used to optimize the model's parameters and improve its performance on the given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Set: The test set is a subset of the data that is used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model once it has been trained. The model has never seen the data in the test set before, and it is used to test how well the model can generalize to new, unseen data. The importance of the test set is that it provides an estimate of the model's performance on new, unseen data, which is a better indicator of the model's usefulness in practice than its performance on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation Set: The validation set is an optional subset of the data that is used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model. Hyperparameters are settings that are not learned during training, such as the learning rate, regularization, or the number of hidden layers. The importance of the validation set is that it provides a way to evaluate the performance of the model on data that is different from both the training and test sets. This allows for the selection of hyperparameters that lead to better generalization performance on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the training set is used to train the machine learning model, the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model on new, unseen data, and the validation set is used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model to improve its generalization performance. The proper use of these three subsets is crucial for developing accurate and reliable machine learning models."

    "Q7- How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a powerful technique for anomaly detection because it allows us to discover patterns or structures in data without relying on labeled examples. Anomalies, by definition, are rare and unexpected events that do not fit the typical patterns or behaviors of the data. Unsupervised learning can help detect anomalies by identifying data points or patterns that deviate significantly from the normal behavior of the system or process being monitored.\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular approach for unsupervised anomaly detection is to use clustering algorithms such as k-means or DBSCAN to group data points that are similar to each other. Anomalies are then identified as data points that do not belong to any cluster or belong to a cluster with very few members. Another approach is to use dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA or t-SNE to project high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, where anomalies can be detected as data points that lie far away from the majority of the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other unsupervised learning techniques that can be used for anomaly detection include density estimation, which models the probability density function of the data and identifies anomalies as low-probability events, and novelty detection, which trains a model on the normal behavior of the system and identifies anomalies as data points that are unlikely to be generated by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, unsupervised learning provides a powerful and flexible approach to anomaly detection, as it can adapt to a wide range of data types and does not require labeled examples of anomalous behavior. However, it is important to carefully evaluate the performance of unsupervised anomaly detection methods, as they may generate false positives or miss rare but important anomalies."
